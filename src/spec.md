# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a social communication app where users can chat with friends via text messages and make one-on-one video calls.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for user login and registration
- Create a friends list management system with friend requests and online/offline status
- Build a real-time text chat interface for messaging between friends
- Store chat messages in the backend with query methods for chat history
- Create a video calling interface with call controls (mute, camera toggle, end call)
- Implement call signaling in the backend to manage video call sessions
- Design a modern UI with warm colors (coral, mint green, soft yellow) and friendly design elements

**User-visible outcome:** Users can authenticate, add friends, send text messages in a chat interface, and make peer-to-peer video calls with their friends in a modern, inviting social app.
